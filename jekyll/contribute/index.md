## Write code

If you want to write a new feature, fork the project, or fix some bugs please feel free to do it! This project is open source under the 
[apache v2]({{ site.license }}) licence. I might be slow in checking the pull requests but will definitly get back to you! You can view the code and clone the project on the button in top bar, or 
[here](https://github.com/{{ site.github.author }}/{{ site.github.project }}). Documentation on how to build and develop the plugin locally coming soon...

## Report a bug

If if you have found a bug, please report it creating a [new issue](https://github.com/{{ site.github.author }}/{{ site.github.project }}/issues/new) on github. Giving more detail (ex: adding a screenshot and description) helps to find the problem. 
Reporting issues when they happen helps make this plugin better, and we appreciate the time it takes to give us this information. As guideline please don't simply write <strong>it doesn't work</strong>, I know the target of this software is most likely developers, still, 
if you have time, read [some guidelines](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) to make everyone's life a bit easier. 

Of course if you spot a broken link in this documentation or even a mispelled word, let me know as described above. Thank you.

you think that it is useful you can support by sending a small contribute. <br/><br/> You can do so by using my bitcoin address below or scanning the qr code on the side. Obviously I am not expecting to 
make a fortune out of this project, but small contributions or even a <strong>thank you</strong> will let me know that there is 
interest around this project, and will make me find the time outside my day to day job to keep developing it.</p>
